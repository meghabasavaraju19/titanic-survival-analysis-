The Titanic incident has led the scientist and investigators to comprehend what can have 
prompted the survival of a few travelers and death of the rest. Many machine learning 
algorithms contributed in predicting the survival rate of passengers. In addition to the this, 
a dataset of 891 rows which includes the attributes namely Age, PassengerID, Sex, Name, 
Embarked, Fare etc. has been used. In this paper, survival of passengers is figured out using 
machine learning technique called logistic regression. The main focus of this work is to 
analyze logistic regression machine learning algorithm to analyze the survival rate of 
traveler based on the accuracy
